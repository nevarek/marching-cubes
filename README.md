# Marching Cubes

Implements the marching cubes algorithm in GDScript

Discovers the limitations of mesh generation only using GDScript, moving the mesh generation to a GDExtension is likely the next logical step and I would recommend that if you're going to use this

Another possible solution is to try using a RenderingDevice to offload processing
